# Undergrad-Dissertation-Analysis
The R script for my undergraduate dissertation "Autism.mp3: A Quantitative Investigation of how Autistic Traits Impact the Experience of Music". I used multiple regression to identify which autistic traits predicted different experiences of music.

I completed this research in 2023 and submitted it as a portion of my MA (SocSci) in Psychology from the University of Glasgow. Due to data protection the original data has since been deleted, but this script is a comprehensive overview of how I conducted all my analyses.

I'm really proud of this work even three years on. As always, the <a href="https://github.com/freyamurray/Undergrad-Dissertation-Analysis/blob/main/ug_analysis.md">markdown</a> version is easiest to read in GitHub.
